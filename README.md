B3/S23 (standard rules)

A cell is "Born" if it has exactly 3 neighbours, 
"Survives" if it has 2 or 3 living neighbours; it dies otherwise.


B23/S23 (this)

A cell is "Born" if it has exactly 2 or 3 neighbours, 
"Survives" if it has exactly 2 or 3 living neighbours; it dies otherwise.


## why (this)? 

for sum of us, numbers are fun

very interesting patterns evolve from symmetrically balanced seeds.


## seeds ?

Simply put, a seed is the starting pattern.

to create a seed:
 1. It's recommended that you start at the very center of the grid.
 2. touch/click to flip a cell between life and death.
 3. press play to watch your seed evolve.


for accuracy in measurement, do not to interfere with the evolution of your seed.
