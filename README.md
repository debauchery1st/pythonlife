# the python life
##  (graveyard edition)

I had intended to write Conway's Game of Life in python.

By misunderstanding the game itself, I uncovered what I like to call the graveyard edition.

In the graveyard, every space on the grid contains a cell.
each of those cells can exist in 1 of 2 states. Alive or Dead.

B23/S23 (this)
  A cell is "re-born" if it has 2 or 3 neighbours.
  It "survives" if it has 2 or 3 living neighbours; it dies otherwise.

## why (this)? 

why not?

very interesting patterns evolve from symmetrically balanced seeds.

## seed ?

a seed is the originating pattern.

to create a seed:

 1. touch/click to flip a cell between life and death.
 2. press play to watch the cells evolve.
