A cell is "Born" if it has exactly 3 neighbours, 
"Survives" if it has 2 or 3 living neighbours; it dies otherwise.


B23/S23 (this)

A cell is "Born" if it has exactly 2 or 3 neighbours, 
"Survives" if it has exactly 2 or 3 living neighbours; it dies otherwise.


## why (this)? 

why not?

very interesting patterns evolve from symmetrically balanced seeds.


## seed ?

a seed is the originating pattern.

to create a seed:

 1. touch/click the grid to flip a cell between life and death.
 2. press play to watch the seed evolve.
